\section{Corrections}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Line 6 - Although not a logical error, found\_value is an unnessesary 
        variable and not used anywhere else in the program
    \item Line 8 - The control statment for the loop is doing a shallow comparsion 
        of objects as opposed to comparing the actual integer values.  It should be 
        changed to i.equals(new Integer(data.length))
    \item Line 9 - Setting is\_found to false on each element that is not the element 
        we are looking for is incorrect.  If the value we are looking for appears 
        before any other value, then we will lose the correct is\_found state.
    \item Line 9 - On top the of the previously mentioned error, comparing Double's 
        with != is not sufficient, !data[i].equals(x) should be used.
    \item Line 11 - The braces on the else have been omitted, this means that 
        is\_found will be set to true on each iteration of the loop, regardless of 
        the outcome of the attached if.
    \item Line 15 - The return statements are mixed up.  Furthermore, lines 15 to 18 
        could be reduced to simply $return\ is\_found$.
